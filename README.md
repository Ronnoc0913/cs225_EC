# CS225 Project Summary
Our proposed final project is to implement the PageRank algorithm, which sorts and ranks webpages based on their search engine results.

# Location of code
All of the code files can be found in our code/ directory.
    1. To run the code, create a build directory within the code/ directory.
    2. CD into the build/ directory and run cmake ..
    3. After the cmake files are created, compile and run the code using make test && ./test
    4. Modify the test cases file in our src/ directory to modify and run whatever dataset you need

# DATA
We used three different test data sets for this algorithm. We used small, medium and large datasets.
For the small data set, we had two test cases, one with no loop which contains 6 nodes, and one with a loop that contains 7 nodes.
The medium dataset, has around 95 nodes.
The large dataset has 8000 nodes

In our documents/ directory, you can find the original proposal, the final written report, and the feedback given by the mentors
