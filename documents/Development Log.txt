What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:
Our goal for this week was to create a function to translate .txt files into a graph for use in the pagerank function.
We accomplished this goal by creating the createAdjacencyMatrix function, and also created another function for the transition probability matrix to be used in the pagerank algorithm.

What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week:
Kris did the function and Connor was on tech support (because Kris couldn't get CMake to work).

What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals:
Spent way too much time trying to get CMake to work, but we accomplished the goals anyway.

What you plan to accomplish next week:
It's fall break, so we don't have anything planned. But when we get back we will start on the pagerank algorithm.

What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not:
Finish PageRank algorithm: technically complete, but not tested becauses the test cases are not done.

What specific tasks each member of your team accomplished in the week:
Connor has written the algorithm and Kris has refined the test cases.

What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals:
We had prior engagements with other classes that required work that put a pause on the progress on this assignment. 
We also had problems with GitHub and Python (because we used it to figure out the test cases).

What you plan to accomplish next week:
We will be done with the project.
