Thanks for the progress update. Good work getting CMake to work! Not entirely sure if you should have the Dockerfile inside your code folder. If you run this project inside the same fa23 container you use for the rest of the 225 mps and labs, the Dockerfile that is in that base folder should suffice. 

Looking forward, I would aim to finish out the remainder of the algorithm, as well as some testing, by early next week. As a reminder, you should get the midpoint meeting scheduled (by Nov 28th latest). You need to have a *working* algorithm to show at this checkin, as well as tests to prove it. 

Looking forward to seeing your progress, and let us know if we can provide you any guidance along the way! Hope you enjoy your Thanksgiving!

Nice job implementing the algorithm. Not sure what you meant regarding the issues with github and python, but let us know if you need any help. Please have the test suite as close to complete as you can before the mid project checkin today. Without them, you can't really prove correctness of your algorithm. Looking forward to chatting!
